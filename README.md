# Smart Irrigation System Using Tiva-C TM4C123GH6PM Launch Pad
Overview
This project aims to revolutionize modern agriculture by integrating smart irrigation management with farm security. Using the Tiva-C TM4C123GH6PM Launch Pad, the system monitors soil moisture levels to optimize irrigation and employs ultrasonic sensors to protect crops from wild animals.

Key Features
Intelligent Irrigation Management
Soil Moisture Sensor:
Captures real-time soil humidity data.
Prevents overwatering and underwatering.
Automated Recommendations:
Recommends irrigation schedules based on moisture levels.
Reduces the need for manual monitoring.
Enhanced Farm Security
Ultrasonic Sensor (HCSR04):
Detects movement within a predefined range.
Helps prevent damage from wild animals and pests.
Buzzer Alarm System:
Activates upon detecting an intruder.
Emits a sound to deter animals from entering the farm.
Benefits
Water Conservation: Reduces water wastage by precisely monitoring soil moisture levels.
Increased Crop Yield: Promotes healthier plant growth, leading to higher yields and better-quality produce.
Cost-Effective Solution: Automates irrigation and security, saving farmers time and resources.
Wildlife-Friendly Security: Uses a humane method to protect crops, ensuring the coexistence of agriculture and wildlife.
